## 🚀 Welcome to the MatsRobot development hub

Our mission is to engineer a full-scale humanoid robot while solving the high-difficulty, less-documented challenges that often act as barriers to entry in advanced robotics. We recognize significant gaps in existing knowledge, ranging from offline speech processing and autonomous face recognition to complex PID servo control and multi-processor communication. 

On the hardware front, we tackle the essential integration of battery management systems, IoT telemetry, and high-precision position feedback loops. Our process goes beyond theory: we prototype and construct complete hardware and software solutions, then transform them into comprehensive, open-source build guides. 

By sharing our full codebase and documentation on GitHub, we aim to provide a library of 'missing links' from computer vision and magnetic encoders to animatronic expressions that any developer can freely use to advance the field of humanoid robotics.
